# TRex
Regular Expressions Tester (aka TRex, formerly also called RExT) is a Firefox add-on for creating and debugging regular expressions.

This repository is meant to be used for the future the development of TRex. This also marks a milestone in the development of the extension, as previous versions were developed privately. With this change the code and resources of the extension also got a different license. While previous versions were published under the GNU General Public License, version 2.0, the code of the versions is now covered by the MIT License.

# Download
The current version can be downloaded from [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/rext/).

# Status
The version in development will be a complete recreation of the previous Regular Expressions Tester extension for Firefox.

It is currently in **research phase**, meaning the basic feature of regular expression matching and highlighting is recreated, additional functionalities available in previous versions will be recreated and new features are investigated.
As this is a very early stage, there is not much to see yet.
